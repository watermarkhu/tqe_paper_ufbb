  The \emph{fragmentation} of node-tree $\pr{k-1}\omega$ into its ancestor node-trees, where the prefix $k-1$ indicates the \emph{fragmentation generation}. The fragmentation $f(\pr{k-1}\omega)$ returns $\nu+1$ odd ancestors of generation $k$. Fragmentation function $f$ can be separated into the \emph{partial fragmentation} $f_\omega(\pr{k-1}\omega)$ that returns an odd ancestor $\pr{k}\omega_0$ and even ancestor $\pr{k}\epsilon$, and subsequently the partial fragmentation $f_\epsilon(\pr{k}\epsilon)$, which returns $\nu$ odd ancestors of generation $k$. With $\nu=2$, each partial fragmentation is the opposite of a join operation between two node-trees. Furthermore, note that if $\abs{\vset_0} = \abs{\vset_1} = \abs{\vset_2}$, the vertex-tree sizes related to node trees $\pr{k}\omega_0, \pr{k}\omega_1, \pr{k}\omega_2$, each generation is the opposite of a growth iteration. \label{fig6}}

The full version of the algorithm we have described is given in Algorithm \ref{algo:ufbb}. Note that this pseudocode includes instructions that are shortened versions of the pseudocode of the Union-Find decoder \cite{delfosse2017almost}. This is done for clarity on the modified additions of the Node-Suspension data structure and protocols on top of the Union-Find pseudocode. The first block of lines \ref{algo:B1a}-\ref{algo:B1b} initializes the clusters and describes the loop of cluster growth. Block 2 contains lines \ref{algo:B2a}-\ref{algo:grow} and describes the DFSs related to calculating the node parities and delays from all even subroots stored at the root node, and the DFS of the cluster growth. Block 3 contains lines \ref{algo:B3a}-\ref{algo:B3b} and describes the combined merging protocols of the Union-Find and Node-Suspension data structures. Note that lines \ref{algo:dfa}-\ref{algo:dfb} contain an extra step that maintains acyclic vertex-trees. The final block in line \ref{algo:B4a} is the peeling decoder \cite{delfosse2017linear}, which now does not have to create the spanning forest of the grown clusters. Similarly to the Union-Find decoder, Weighted Growth is applied such that the smaller cluster is always grown first.
