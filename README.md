# The repository for the paper "Quasilinear-Time Decoding Algorithm for Topological Codes with High Decoding Performance"

The surface code is one of the most promising quantum error-correcting codes due to its high threshold and its suitability for planar implementations with near neighbor interactions. A plethora of recent work has focused on making surface codes practical by improving the classical processing of the code while minimizing the impact on the threshold. Here, we build on top of the recently introduced union-find decoder, a decoder with a quasi-linear time complexity and a high threshold. The modified decoder, dubbed the union-find node-suspension decoder, outperforms the union-find decoder on any lattice size while retaining a quasi-linear worst-case time complexity. Moreover, both for small lattice sizes and also for low error rates, the new decoder performs near identically to the minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder.
